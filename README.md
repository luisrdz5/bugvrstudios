The information about this step are in the dir ./data

to this task we run the run.js script to run this script you need

firebase-admin — npm module, you can install it locally to the folder of the script (we do that)
service-key.json — file we’ve generated in the Authentication section of firebase
data.json — actually the data we want to push to our Firestore
